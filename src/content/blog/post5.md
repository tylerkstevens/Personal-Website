A valuable, untapped market exists for mining focused on heat reuse applications.

What if instead of focusing on marginal hashrate efficiency improvements, ASIC manufacturers dedicated their efforts towards reliable, high operating temperature chips intended for heat reuse applications?

Through collaborative open-source initiatives and the concerted efforts by dedicated chip architecture teams, I believe it is possible to pool resources and expertise to develop these chips and physically decentralize hash rate.
