We touched on a variety of topics, with plebs and experts weighing in to give their two sats. 

Our conversation covered:

- Use Case Applications
- Firmware
- Network Decentralization
- Aligned Incentives
- Hardware and Form Factors
- Economics
- Innovations and Limitations
- And more!

At the end of the chat, I accidentally pressed the wrong button and logged out of my X account, killing the spaces and rug pulling everyone. Whoops. Don't be like me and be careful what you press.
