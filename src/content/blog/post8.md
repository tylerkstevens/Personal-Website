This presentation expanded on the topics discussed on the X Spaces conversation I hosted a few weeks ago (see my last blog post).

The presentation covers:

- What is mining for heat?
- Thermodynamic and heat transfer fundamentals
- Energy quantity vs quality
- ASIC waste heat use cases
- Three thermal tiers of mining for heat
- Hardware for heat reuse
- Firmware and software
- Controling heat reuse from ASICs
- Economics of mining for heat
- Benefits
