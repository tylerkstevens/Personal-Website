It is my theory that we will see an effort to develop bitcoin mining ASIC chips designed for increased operating temperature and resilience. As generational improvements in hashing efficiency deminish, there's more reason than ever to treat mining heat output as a product, increasing total system operational efficiency.

Check out my first article on the Braiins Blog, where I agrue this case.
