In late March of 2024, I recorded a video review of my 1995 Nissan D21 Pickup Truck (Hardbody) with Kase from The Fast Lane YouTube channel. Thanks to TFL for having me out. What a fun day. I've been watching their automtive reviews since I was in high school, so it was a treat to spend some time with the crew.

As noted in the video, I purchased the truck off of Cars & Bids, the online automitve enthusiast action site. Check out the details [here](https://carsandbids.com/auctions/3R2Po4QD/1995-nissan-pickup-xe-v6-4x4)!
