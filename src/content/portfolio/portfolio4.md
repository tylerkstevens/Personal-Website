## What

üö® Attention Heatpunks, home miners, manufacturers, plebs, and industrial hashers:

The Hashrate Heatpunk Forum is now live!

Brought to you by The Space ‚Äî this public platform is your one-stop hub to learn, share, and discuss the future of hashrate heating.

## Why

For too long, hashrate heating knowledge was scattered across private chats, telegram groups, and various sites.

We needed one place to organize ideas, post builds, share knowledge and grow the movement.

## Topics

The forum covers everything from:
‚Ä¢ Product highlights
‚Ä¢ System designs
‚Ä¢ Radiant heat & HVAC integrations
‚Ä¢ Firmware & control
‚Ä¢ Pool splits & business models
‚Ä¢ Regulatory hurdles
‚Ä¢ And more.

## What you can do

‚Ä¢ Ask questions
‚Ä¢ Share your projects
‚Ä¢ Contribute research
‚Ä¢ Connect with tradesmen
‚Ä¢ Learn the heating industry
‚Ä¢ Help others get started
‚Ä¢ Shape the future of mining for heat

## Open Source, Open Access

‚ÄúHeatpunk‚Äù is an open-source idea.
Join this movement - be a heatpunk!

This forum ‚Äî Hashrate Heatpunks ‚Äî is the official community platform managed by @SpaceDenver.

Information shared here is public and available for all.

## High Signal

Our private HRHP Telegram chat for hardcore builders still exists. And our official X account @HashHeatpunks was just created.

But now the public can see what we‚Äôre working on, contribute ideas, and move this thing forward together.

We want all hands on deck.

## Join Us

Whether you‚Äôre heating a home or business with hashrate, prototyping new devices and systems, or just curious about how Bitcoin heat works ‚Äî we built this place for you.
